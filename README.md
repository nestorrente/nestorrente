### Hi there! 👋

I'm Néstor, a senior software developer located in Vigo, Spain. I'm currently working at [ManoMano](https://www.manomano.es/).

I love development. I started programming little video games as a hobby when I was around 15, much time before it came to a job. I defend that writing software is an art, just like poetry or painting.

If you wanna get it touch, you can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nestorpglez/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nestorrente).

Happy coding! 💻

#### Random facts about myself

* I've spoken once in a meetup, and I would like to repeat it soon 🙂 here you can check the meetup information: [Building a chatroom with Vue.js, Java and RSocket](https://www.meetup.com/es/VigoJUG/events/267185946/).
* I participate in the [Java Challenge Spain 2019](https://www.muycomputerpro.com/zona-ticjob/between-java-challenge-de-espana/) (and won! 🏆 😀)
* I used to develop video games when I was young(er) 🎮 [here you can watch gameplay of one of those games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SxHH6kbzGI).
